Computer Vision Algorithms:

* Camera Calibration: 

The process of computing the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is called camera calibration. Generally, the camera calibration process uses images of a 3D object with a geometrical pattern (e.g. checker board). The pattern is called the calibration grid. The 3D co-ordinates of the pattern are matched to 2D image points. 

* Epipolar Geometry

* Distortion Correction

* Bundle Adjustment
